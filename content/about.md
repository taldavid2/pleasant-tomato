I started my education at York University in Toronto where I studied health and exercise science and received my degree with a specialized honors. I quickly realized I still wanted to learn more and decided that naturopathic medicine would be the right path for me. I went on and graduated from the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine. 

After practicing in Toronto for a bit I took the leap and started a new job out in Thailand at a luxury wellness resort. After working in Thailand for a few years I ended up taking another job in Hong Kong helping to launch and develop parts of a new wellness concept for another ultra luxury property.

And now I am back in Thailand, doing more research and development while still consulting with guests. The best of both worlds, for me anyways.
